# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-12)

**Core value:** The generic boss-kill → carrier-item → main-world-apply mechanism (BossRegistry + BossCoreItem + GlobalNPC) must reliably reproduce a boss's full "downed" state — flags, netcode sync, and any WorldGen side effects — for any registered boss.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — calamity-integration-cross-mod-side-effect-reproduction

## Current Position

Phase: 5
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Reflection/weak-reference cross-mod access helper is NOT a standalone phase — it's built as needed inside Phase 4 (Calamity), the first real content-mod integration, since it has no requirement of its own to anchor a phase to.
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (registry/item/GlobalNPC pipeline) proven with one vanilla boss before any content-mod integration, isolating pipeline-mechanism risk from per-mod API risk.
- Roadmap: Weak-references vs. pure-reflection tension (flagged in research/SUMMARY.md Gaps) is unresolved — needs explicit decision during Phase 4 planning, likely via `/gsd:research-phase`.
- [Phase 01]: GameConfiguration lives in Terraria.IO, not Terraria.WorldBuilding -- confirmed via reflection against installed tModLoader.dll
- [Phase 01]: Plain dotnet build/msbuild cannot resolve build.txt modReferences (runtime-only mechanism) -- added a gitignored, locally-extracted Libs/SubworldLibrary.dll compile-time Reference (Private=false) alongside the authoritative build.txt declaration
- [Phase 01]: Mod scaffold files (BossArenaSubWorld.cs, .csproj, build.txt, Properties/, Localization/, icons, description files) were untracked in git prior to this phase, causing isolated parallel worktrees to independently reconstruct them; scaffold is now committed to git as part of 01-01/01-02 merge, closing this gap for future worktree-isolated plans.
- [Phase 01]: BiomeOverridePlayer.cs references the Subworld type via using+unqualified name instead of fully-qualified path, avoiding CS0426 collision with the BossArenaSubWorld Mod class
- [Phase 01]: CRITICAL: Live King Slime isolation test shows NPC.downedSlimeKing=True after subworld round-trip (expected False) -- isolation premise NOT confirmed, contradicts 01-RESEARCH.md's source-traced expectation; Phase 2 planning blocked pending re-investigation
- [Phase 02]: Generalized D-09 as calling NPC.SpawnOnPlayer with the mapped boss type (vanilla summon items have no isolated, externally-callable use-effect method)
- [Phase 02]: Used SubworldSystem.IsActive<BossArenaSubworld>(), not AnyActive, correcting a non-compiling example in 02-RESEARCH.md (AnyActive requires where T : Mod)
- [Phase 02]: Used ModTile.RightClick, not NewRightClick -- the installed tModLoader.dll only exposes RightClick(int,int)->bool on ModTile, confirmed via MetadataLoadContext reflection against the real local binary
- [Phase 02]: Gitignored Libs/SubworldLibrary.dll compile-time reference must be manually copied into each fresh git worktree before dotnet build succeeds (not a code gap, a per-worktree setup step)
- [Phase 02]: User-confirmed live test proves SUBW-01..04 via Test1Tile redirect; treated '전부 통과했어' as the plan's exact resume-signal
- [Phase 02]: Deleted Debug/SubworldDebugCommands.cs in full now that Tiles/Test1Tile.cs redirect and SubworldLibrary's Return button fully supersede it (closes Phase 1 D-02)
- [Phase 03]: Fixed NpcTypes array literal (short->int[]) and CloneNewInstances access modifier (public->protected) to match installed tModLoader 1.4.4.9 API -- plan's illustrative code had two compile-blocking bugs
- [Phase 03]: Live King Slime pipeline test confirms full BossRegistry/BossCoreItem/GlobalNPC pipeline end-to-end (DROP-02, DROP-03, APPLY-01, APPLY-04); Test1Item's missing acquisition path is a carried-over Phase 2 gap (D-05), not a Phase 3 defect
- [Phase 04]: Confirmed installed CalamityMod version (2.2.4) by reading the .tmod's own header field during extraction, matching build.txt's weakReferences declaration exactly
- [Phase 04]: ApplyHiveMindDowned() deliberately omits CalamityGlobalNPC.SetNewBossJustDowned() per 04-RESEARCH.md correction -- it is player-scoped speedrun-timer bookkeeping already applied live during the subworld kill; replaying it would double-apply
- [Phase 04]: Resolved debug session `hivemind-zonecorrupt-despawn-corruption-subworld` (was blocking 04-02-PLAN.md's live verification checkpoint) -- Hive Mind despawn traced to missing Corruption biome tiles (player.ZoneCorrupt never true, no corruption tiles in the plain-stone arena); fixed via a new BossArenaCorruptionSubworld + CorruptionPlatformPass (full-width Ebonstone/CorruptGrass platform) and a boss-aware BossArenaRoutingRegistry replacing hardcoded BossArenaSubworld checks in Test1Tile/BossSummonPlayer/BossCoreDropRule. Also confirmed the follow-up "double Sky Ore message" symptom is expected, non-bug behavior (matches PITFALLS.md Pitfall 1's carrier-item architecture exactly) via decompilation, not a state-corruption bug. User confirmed fix live in-game (checklist items 1-5 passed); optional final spot-checks (flag persistence across save/relaunch, no third message on repeat use) explicitly skipped by user as redundant with the already-confirmed mechanism. See .planning/debug/resolved/hivemind-zonecorrupt-despawn-corruption-subworld.md.
- [Phase 04]: [Phase 04]: Delegates/lambdas passed into [JITWhenModsEnabled]-guarded registration calls (BossDefinition's ApplyDowned/IsDowned) must be named, separately-tagged methods -- never inline lambdas -- since the C# compiler hoists inline lambdas into a <>c cache-class method that does NOT inherit the enclosing method's JIT-guard attribute, causing a real JITException when the weak-referenced mod is disabled. Confirmed live: fixed in Integrations/CalamityIntegration.cs (commit 0e19600) after Task 2's CalamityMod-disabled load test crashed. Applies to every future per-boss registration (Spirit, Redemption, CatalystMod, NoxusBoss, ContinentOfJourney/Daybreak).
- [Phase 04]: [Phase 04]: Task 1's live WorldGen/netcode verification checkpoint was satisfied by evidence gathered during the immediately-preceding resolved debug session (hivemind-zonecorrupt-despawn-corruption-subworld), not a duplicate live test -- user explicitly confirmed the debug session used a fresh throwaway world with Evil Type = Corruption (not the real save), matching Task 1's exact acceptance criteria.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 planning should resolve the weak-reference+[JITWhenModsEnabled] vs. pure-reflection disagreement between research files before writing the first Integrations/*.cs file (see research/SUMMARY.md Gaps).
- Phases 6-7 (Redemption, CatalystMod, NoxusBoss, ContinentOfJourney/Daybreak) have entirely unresearched APIs — each will likely need a `/gsd:research-phase` pass before detailed planning.
- Isolation premise NOT empirically confirmed: live King Slime kill test shows NPC.downedSlimeKing=True in the main world after subworld round-trip (expected False per 01-RESEARCH.md/PITFALLS.md, which both explicitly predicted vanilla flags behave the same as modded ones for this bug). Do NOT proceed to Phase 2/3 planning until re-investigated -- see 01-04-SUMMARY.md hypotheses (in-memory-only leak vs. genuine on-disk persistence vs. vanilla-specific behavior difference). Also unconfirmed: inventory-intact check (SUBW-06) was skipped by tester during this run.
