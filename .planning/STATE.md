# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-12)

**Core value:** The generic boss-kill → carrier-item → main-world-apply mechanism (BossRegistry + BossCoreItem + GlobalNPC) must reliably reproduce a boss's full "downed" state — flags, netcode sync, and any WorldGen side effects — for any registered boss.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Subworld Skeleton & Isolation Proof

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Subworld Skeleton & Isolation Proof)
Plan: 4 of 04 complete (01-01: Build-Environment Prerequisites; 01-02: Subworld skeleton -- GenPass + Subworld subclass; 01-03: Debug entry/exit tooling + biome-override hook)
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-12

Progress: [████████░░] 75%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Reflection/weak-reference cross-mod access helper is NOT a standalone phase — it's built as needed inside Phase 4 (Calamity), the first real content-mod integration, since it has no requirement of its own to anchor a phase to.
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (registry/item/GlobalNPC pipeline) proven with one vanilla boss before any content-mod integration, isolating pipeline-mechanism risk from per-mod API risk.
- Roadmap: Weak-references vs. pure-reflection tension (flagged in research/SUMMARY.md Gaps) is unresolved — needs explicit decision during Phase 4 planning, likely via `/gsd:research-phase`.
- [Phase 01]: GameConfiguration lives in Terraria.IO, not Terraria.WorldBuilding -- confirmed via reflection against installed tModLoader.dll
- [Phase 01]: Plain dotnet build/msbuild cannot resolve build.txt modReferences (runtime-only mechanism) -- added a gitignored, locally-extracted Libs/SubworldLibrary.dll compile-time Reference (Private=false) alongside the authoritative build.txt declaration
- [Phase 01]: Mod scaffold files (BossArenaSubWorld.cs, .csproj, build.txt, Properties/, Localization/, icons, description files) were untracked in git prior to this phase, causing isolated parallel worktrees to independently reconstruct them; scaffold is now committed to git as part of 01-01/01-02 merge, closing this gap for future worktree-isolated plans.
- [Phase 01]: BiomeOverridePlayer.cs references the Subworld type via using+unqualified name instead of fully-qualified path, avoiding CS0426 collision with the BossArenaSubWorld Mod class
- [Phase 01]: CRITICAL: Live King Slime isolation test shows NPC.downedSlimeKing=True after subworld round-trip (expected False) -- isolation premise NOT confirmed, contradicts 01-RESEARCH.md's source-traced expectation; Phase 2 planning blocked pending re-investigation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 planning should resolve the weak-reference+[JITWhenModsEnabled] vs. pure-reflection disagreement between research files before writing the first Integrations/*.cs file (see research/SUMMARY.md Gaps).
- Phases 6-7 (Redemption, CatalystMod, NoxusBoss, ContinentOfJourney/Daybreak) have entirely unresearched APIs — each will likely need a `/gsd:research-phase` pass before detailed planning.
- Isolation premise NOT empirically confirmed: live King Slime kill test shows NPC.downedSlimeKing=True in the main world after subworld round-trip (expected False per 01-RESEARCH.md/PITFALLS.md, which both explicitly predicted vanilla flags behave the same as modded ones for this bug). Do NOT proceed to Phase 2/3 planning until re-investigated -- see 01-04-SUMMARY.md hypotheses (in-memory-only leak vs. genuine on-disk persistence vs. vanilla-specific behavior difference). Also unconfirmed: inventory-intact check (SUBW-06) was skipped by tester during this run.
