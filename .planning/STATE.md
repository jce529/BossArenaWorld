# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-12)

**Core value:** The generic boss-kill → carrier-item → main-world-apply mechanism (BossRegistry + BossCoreItem + GlobalNPC) must reliably reproduce a boss's full "downed" state — flags, netcode sync, and any WorldGen side effects — for any registered boss.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Subworld Skeleton & Isolation Proof

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Subworld Skeleton & Isolation Proof)
Plan: 02 of 4 complete (01-02: Subworld skeleton -- GenPass + Subworld subclass)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-08-13 — Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (FlatStonePlatformPass + BossArenaSubworld)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Reflection/weak-reference cross-mod access helper is NOT a standalone phase — it's built as needed inside Phase 4 (Calamity), the first real content-mod integration, since it has no requirement of its own to anchor a phase to.
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (registry/item/GlobalNPC pipeline) proven with one vanilla boss before any content-mod integration, isolating pipeline-mechanism risk from per-mod API risk.
- Roadmap: Weak-references vs. pure-reflection tension (flagged in research/SUMMARY.md Gaps) is unresolved — needs explicit decision during Phase 4 planning, likely via `/gsd:research-phase`.
- [Phase 01]: GameConfiguration lives in Terraria.IO, not Terraria.WorldBuilding -- confirmed via reflection against installed tModLoader.dll
- [Phase 01]: Plain dotnet build/msbuild cannot resolve build.txt modReferences (runtime-only mechanism) -- added a gitignored, locally-extracted Libs/SubworldLibrary.dll compile-time Reference (Private=false) alongside the authoritative build.txt declaration

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 planning should resolve the weak-reference+[JITWhenModsEnabled] vs. pure-reflection disagreement between research files before writing the first Integrations/*.cs file (see research/SUMMARY.md Gaps).
- Phases 6-7 (Redemption, CatalystMod, NoxusBoss, ContinentOfJourney/Daybreak) have entirely unresearched APIs — each will likely need a `/gsd:research-phase` pass before detailed planning.
